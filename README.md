# winnuke
My original port of winnuke to BeOS from many years ago

My userid in various BeOS forums was "moooooooo". 
Yes me, Peter.

Changes
------------------------------------------------------------------
although i've changed "snooze" to "sleep" to use it on macOS.
I'll put in some ifdefs when i get a BeOS install up in VirtualBox.
The net_server.PPC and net_server.x86 binaries were uploaded to the BeBits.com website by 3rd party BeOS devs as i'd originally compiled it for BeOS BONE x86 but supplied the source code which i found via an AltaVista search back in the day. 
There was a reason i released this and you can search the BeBits.com website using the internet archive and have a look at all of the comments around why i released it and the comments for and against me releasing it :-)

BeBits.com no longer exists. Internet archive will have everything.

Plans
------------------------------------------------------------------
if i get around to it, and i will.
i'll post, online, all of the BeOS packages i can find in my downalods directories and other areas on multiple backups on multiple installs.

But i will go back, as i;ve found an old BeOS backup which my contain the orig source, but TBH the source here ? Is orig, apart from the BeOS additions.
