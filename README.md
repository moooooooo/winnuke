# winnuke
My original port of winnuke to BeOS from many years ago, although i've changed "snooze" to "sleep" to use it on macOS.
I'll put in some ifdefs when i get a BeOS install up in VirtualBox.
The net_server.PPC and net_server.x86 binaries were uploaded to the BeBits.com website by 3rd party BeOS devs as i'd originally compiled it for BeOS BONE x86 but supplied the source code which i found via an AltaVista search back in the day. 
There was a reason i released this and you can search the BeBits.com website using the internet archive and have a look at all of the comments around why i released it and the comments for and against me releasing it :-)
